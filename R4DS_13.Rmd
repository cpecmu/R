# 13 Relational Data

## Relational Data : Introduction

- It's rare that a data analysis involves only a single data frame.
Typically you have many data frames, and you must combine them to answer the questions that you're interested in.

- Collectively, multiple data frames are called **relational data** because it is the relations, not just the individual datasets, that are important.

## Relational Data : Introduction

- Relations are always defined between a pair of data frames.

- All other relations are built up from this simple idea: the relations of three or more data frames are always a property of the relations between each pair.

- Sometimes both elements of a pair can be the same data frame!
This is needed if, for example, you have a data frame of people, and each person has a reference to their parents.

## Relational Data : Introduction

To work with relational data you need verbs that work with pairs of data frames.
There are three families of verbs designed to work with relational data:

-   **Mutating joins**, which add new variables to one data frame from matching observations in another.

-   **Filtering joins**, which filter observations from one data frame based on whether or not they match an observation in the other data frame.

-   **Set operations**, which treat observations as if they were set elements.


## 13.1.1 Prerequisites {.smaller}

We will explore relational data from `nycflights13` using the two-table verbs from dplyr.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)
```

## 13.2 nycflights13 {.smaller}

nycflights13 contains five tibbles : `airlines`, `airports`, `weather` and `planes` which are all related to the `flights` data frame that you used earlier.

`airlines` lets you look up the full carrier name from its abbreviated code:

```{r, class.output="scroll-100"}
airlines
```


## 13.2 nycflights13 {.smaller}

`airports` gives information about each airport, identified by the FAA airport code:

```{r}
airports
```

## 13.2 nycflights13 {.smaller}

`weather` gives the weather at each NYC airport for each hour:

```{r}
weather
```

## 13.2 nycflights13

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/245292d1ea724f6c3fd8a92063dcd7bfb9758d02/5751b/diagrams/relational-nycflights.png')
```

## 13.2 nycflights13 

-   `flights` connects to `planes` via a single variable, `tailnum`.

-   `flights` connects to `airlines` through the `carrier` variable.

-   `flights` connects to `airports` in two ways: via the `origin` and `dest` variables.

-   `flights` connects to `weather` via `origin` (the location), and `year`, `month`, `day` and `hour` (the time).

## 13.3 Keys

- The variables used to connect each pair of data frames are called **keys**.

- A key is a variable (or set of variables) that uniquely identifies an observation.

- In simple cases, a single variable is sufficient to identify an observation.

- For example, each plane is uniquely identified by its `tailnum`.
In other cases, multiple variables may be needed.

- For example, to identify an observation in `weather` you need five variables: `year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`, and `origin`.

## 13.3 Keys

There are two types of keys:

-   A **primary key** uniquely identifies an observation in its own data frame.
    For example, `planes$tailnum` is a primary key because it uniquely identifies each plane in the `planes` data frame.

-   A **foreign key** uniquely identifies an observation in another data frame.
    For example, `flights$tailnum` is a foreign key because it appears in the `flights` data frame where it matches each flight to a unique plane.

## 13.3 Keys

A variable can be both a primary key *and* a foreign key.
For example, `origin` is part of the `weather` primary key, and is also a foreign key for the `airports` data frame.

## 13.3 Keys

Once you've identified the primary keys in your data frames, it's good practice to verify that they do indeed uniquely identify each observation.
One way to do that is to `count()` the primary keys and look for entries where `n` is greater than one:

```{r}
planes %>% 
  count(tailnum) %>% 
  filter(n > 1)
```

## 13.3 Keys

```{r}
weather %>% 
  count(year, month, day, hour, origin) %>% 
  filter(n > 1)
```

## 13.3 Keys

```{r}
flights %>% 
  count(year, month, day, flight) %>% 
  filter(n > 1)
```

## 13.3 Keys

```{r}
flights %>% 
  count(year, month, day, tailnum) %>% 
  filter(n > 1)
```

## 13.3 Keys

- A primary key and the corresponding foreign key in another data frame form a **relation**.

- Relations are typically one-to-many.
For example, each flight has one plane, but each plane has many flights.

- In other data, you'll occasionally see a 1-to-1 relationship.
You can think of this as a special case of 1-to-many.

- You can model many-to-many relations with a many-to-1 relation plus a 1-to-many relation.
For example, in this data there's a many-to-many relationship between airlines and airports: each airline flies to many airports; each airport hosts many airlines.

## 13.4 Mutating joins

```{r}
flights2 <- flights %>% 
  select(year:day, hour, origin, dest, tailnum, carrier)
flights2
```

## 13.4 Mutating joins {.smaller}

Imagine you want to add the full airline name to the `flights2` data.
You can combine the `airlines` and `flights2` data frames with `left_join()`:

```{r}
flights2 %>%
  select(-origin, -dest) %>% 
  left_join(airlines, by = "carrier")
```

## 13.4 Mutating joins {.smaller}

In this case, you could have got to the same place using `mutate()` and R's base subsetting:

```{r}
flights2 %>%
  select(-origin, -dest) %>% 
  mutate(name = airlines$name[match(carrier, airlines$carrier)])
```

## 13.4.1 Understanding joins {.smaller}

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='30%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/108c0749d084c03103f8e1e8276c20e06357b124/5f113/diagrams/join-setup.png')
```

```{r}
x <- tribble(
  ~key, ~val_x,
     1, "x1",
     2, "x2",
     3, "x3"
)
y <- tribble(
  ~key, ~val_y,
     1, "y1",
     2, "y2",
     4, "y3"
)
```

## 13.4.2 Inner join

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='60%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/3abea0b730526c3f053a3838953c35a0ccbe8980/7f29b/diagrams/join-inner.png')
```

```{r}
x %>% 
  inner_join(y, by = "key")
```

## 13.4.3 Outer joins

An inner join keeps observations that appear in both data frames.
An **outer join** keeps observations that appear in at least one of the data frames.
There are three types of outer joins:

-   A **left join** keeps all observations in `x`.

-   A **right join** keeps all observations in `y`.

-   A **full join** keeps all observations in `x` and `y`.

## 13.4.3 Outer joins

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='40%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/9c12ca9e12ed26a7c5d2aa08e36d2ac4fb593f1e/79980/diagrams/join-outer.png')
```

## 13.4.3 Outer joins

Another way to depict the different types of joins is with a Venn diagram:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='80%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/aeab386461820b029b7e7606ccff1286f623bae1/ef0d4/diagrams/join-venn.png')
```

## 13.4.4 Duplicate keys

So far all the diagrams have assumed that the keys are unique.
But that's not always the case.
This section explains what happens when the keys are not unique.
There are two possibilities:

1.  One data frame has duplicate keys.

2.  Both data frames have duplicate keys.

## 13.4.4 Duplicate keys

**1. One data frame has duplicate keys.** This is useful when you want to add in additional information as there is typically a one-to-many relationship.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='70%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/6faac3e996263827cb57fc5803df6192541a9a4b/c7d74/diagrams/join-one-to-many.png')
```

## 13.4.4 Duplicate keys {.smaller}

```{r}
x <- tribble(
  ~key, ~val_x,
     1, "x1",
     2, "x2",
     2, "x3",
     1, "x4"
)
y <- tribble(
  ~key, ~val_y,
     1, "y1",
     2, "y2"
)
left_join(x, y, by = "key")
```

## 13.4.4 Duplicate keys

**2. Both tables have duplicate keys.** This is usually an error because in neither table do the keys uniquely identify an observation. When you join duplicated keys, you get all possible combinations, the Cartesian product:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='70%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/d37530bbf7749f48c02684013ae72b2996b07e25/37510/diagrams/join-many-to-many.png')
```

## 13.4.4 Duplicate keys {.smaller}

```{r}
x <- tribble(
  ~key, ~val_x,
     1, "x1",
     2, "x2",
     2, "x3",
     3, "x4"
)
y <- tribble(
  ~key, ~val_y,
     1, "y1",
     2, "y2",
     2, "y3",
     3, "y4"
)
left_join(x, y, by = "key")
```

## 13.5 Filtering joins

Filtering joins match observations in the same way as mutating joins, but affect the observations, not the variables.
There are two types:

-   `semi_join(x, y)` **keeps** all observations in `x` that have a match in `y`.

-   `anti_join(x, y)` **drops** all observations in `x` that have a match in `y`.

## Semi-joins {.smaller}

Semi-joins are useful for matching filtered summary tables back to the original rows. For example, imagine you’ve found the top ten most popular destinations:

```{r}
top_dest <- flights %>%
  count(dest, sort = TRUE) %>%
  head(10)
top_dest
```

## Semi-joins {.smaller}

Now you want to find each flight that went to one of those destinations. You could construct a filter yourself:

```{r}
flights %>% 
  filter(dest %in% top_dest$dest)
```

## Semi-joins {.smaller}

Instead you can use a semi-join, which connects the two data frames like a mutating join, but instead of adding new columns, only keeps the rows in `x` that have a match in `y`:

```{r, class.output="scroll-100"}
flights %>% 
  semi_join(top_dest)
```

## Semi-joins

Graphically, a semi-join looks like this:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='70%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/028065a7f353a932d70d2dfc82bc5c5966f768ad/85a30/diagrams/join-semi.png')
```

## Semi-joins

Only the existence of a match is important; it doesn’t matter which observation is matched. This means that filtering joins never duplicate rows like mutating joins do:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='70%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/e1d0283160251afaeca35cba216736eb995fee00/1b3cd/diagrams/join-semi-many.png')
```

## Anti-joins

The inverse of a semi-join is an anti-join.
An anti-join keeps the rows that *don't* have a match:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='70%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/f29a85efd53a079cc84c14ba4ba6894e238c3759/c1408/diagrams/join-anti.png')
```

## Anti-joins {.smaller}

Anti-joins are useful for diagnosing join mismatches.
For example, when connecting `flights` and `planes`, you might be interested to know that there are many `flights` that don't have a match in `planes`:

```{r}
flights %>%
  anti_join(planes, by = "tailnum") %>%
  count(tailnum, sort = TRUE)
```

## 13.7 Set operations

The final type of two-table verb are the set operations.
Generally, they are occasionally useful when you want to break a single complex filter into simpler pieces.
All these operations work with a complete row, comparing the values of every variable.
These expect the `x` and `y` inputs to have the same variables, and treat the observations like sets:

-   `intersect(x, y)`: return only observations in both `x` and `y`.

-   `union(x, y)`: return unique observations in `x` and `y`.

-   `setdiff(x, y)`: return observations in `x`, but not in `y`.

## 13.7 Set operations

Given this simple data:

```{r}
df1 <- tribble(
  ~x, ~y,
   1,  1,
   2,  1
)
df2 <- tribble(
  ~x, ~y,
   1,  1,
   1,  2
)
```

## 13.7 Set operations : `intersect()`

```{r}
intersect(df1, df2)
```

## 13.7 Set operations : `union()`

```{r}
# Note that we get 3 rows, not 4
union(df1, df2)
```

## 13.7 Set operations : `setdiff()`

```{r}
setdiff(df1, df2)
setdiff(df2, df1)
```
