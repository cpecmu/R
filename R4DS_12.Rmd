# 12 Tidy Data

## Tidy Data : Introduction

- In this chapter, we will learn a consistent way to organise your data in R, an organisation called **tidy data**. 

- Getting your data into this format requires some upfront work, but that work pays off in the long term. 

- Once you have tidy data and the tidy tools provided by packages in the tidyverse, you will spend much less time munging data from one representation to another, allowing you to spend more time on the analytic questions at hand.

## 12.1.1 Prerequisites {.smaller}

In this chapter we’ll focus on tidyr, a package that provides a bunch of tools to help tidy up your messy datasets. tidyr is a member of the core tidyverse.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

## 12.2 Tidy Data

- You can represent the same underlying data in multiple ways. 

- The example below shows the same data organised in four different ways. 

- Each dataset shows the same values of four variables country, year, population, and cases, but each dataset organises the values in a different way.

## Ex: table1

```{r}
table1
```

## Ex: table2

```{r}
table2
```

## Ex: table3

```{r}
table3
```

## Ex: table4a and table4b {.smaller}

```{r}
# Spread across two tibbles
table4a  # cases
table4b  # population
```

## 12.2 Tidy Data

- These are all representations of the same underlying data, but they are not equally easy to use. 

- One dataset, the tidy dataset, will be much easier to work with inside the tidyverse.

## 12.2 Tidy Data

There are three interrelated rules which make a dataset tidy:

- Each variable must have its own column.

- Each observation must have its own row.

- Each value must have its own cell.

## 12.2 Tidy Data

Three rules makes a dataset tidy: variables are in columns, observations are in rows, and values are in cells.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/6f1ddb544fc5c69a2478e444ab8112fb0eea23f8/91adc/images/tidy-1.png')
```

## 12.2 Tidy Data

In this example, only `table1` is tidy. It’s the only representation where each column is a variable.

Why ensure that your data is tidy? 2 main advantages:

- There’s a general advantage to picking one consistent way of storing data. If you have a consistent data structure, it’s easier to learn the tools that work with it because they have an underlying uniformity.

- There’s a specific advantage to placing variables in columns because it allows R’s vectorised nature to shine. As you learned in mutate and summary functions, most built-in R functions work with vectors of values. That makes transforming tidy data feel particularly natural.

## 12.2 Tidy Data

dplyr, ggplot2, and all the other packages in the tidyverse are designed to work with tidy data. Here are a couple of small examples showing how you might work with `table1`.

```{r}
# Compute rate per 10,000
table1 %>% 
  mutate(rate = cases / population * 10000)
```

## 12.2 Tidy Data

```{r}
# Compute cases per year
table1 %>% 
  count(year, wt = cases)
```

## 12.2 Tidy Data {.smaller}

```{r, out.width='80%', fig.align='center'}
# Visualise changes over time
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(table1, aes(year, cases)) + 
  geom_line(aes(group = country), colour = "grey50") + 
  geom_point(aes(colour = country))
```

# 12.3 Pivoting

## 12.3 Pivoting

The principles of tidy data seem so obvious that you might wonder if you’ll ever encounter a dataset that isn’t tidy. Unfortunately, however, most data that you will encounter will be untidy. There are 2 main reasons:

1. Most people aren’t familiar with the principles of tidy data, and it’s hard to derive them yourself unless you spend a lot of time working with data.

2. Data is often organised to facilitate some use other than analysis. For example, data is often organised to make entry as easy as possible.

## 12.3 Pivoting

This means for most real analyses, you’ll need to do some tidying. The first step is always to figure out what the variables and observations are. Sometimes this is easy; other times you’ll need to consult with the people who originally generated the data. The second step is to resolve one of two common problems:

1. One variable might be spread across multiple columns.

2. One observation might be scattered across multiple rows.

## 12.3 Pivoting

Typically a dataset will only suffer from one of these problems; it’ll only suffer from both if you’re really unlucky! To fix these problems, you’ll need the two most important functions in tidyr: `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()`.

## 12.3.1 Longer

A common problem is a dataset where some of the column names are not names of variables, but values of a variable. 

Take table4a: the column names 1999 and 2000 represent values of the year variable, the values in the 1999 and 2000 columns represent values of the cases variable, and each row represents two observations, not one.

```{r}
table4a
```

## 12.3.1 Longer

To tidy a dataset like this, we need to **pivot** the offending columns into a new pair of variables. To describe that operation we need three parameters:

- The set of columns whose names are values, not variables. In this example, those are the columns 1999 and 2000.

- The name of the variable to move the column names to. Here it is year.

- The name of the variable to move the column values to. Here it’s cases.

## 12.3.1 Longer

Together those parameters generate the call to `pivot_longer()`:

```{r}
table4a %>% 
  pivot_longer(c(`1999`, `2000`), names_to = "year", values_to = "cases")
```

## 12.3.1 Longer

Pivoting `table4` into a longer, tidy form.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/3aea19108d39606bbe49981acda07696c0c7fcd8/2de65/images/tidy-9.png')
```

## 12.3.1 Longer

We can use `pivot_longer()` to tidy `table4b` in a similar fashion. The only difference is the variable stored in the cell values:

```{r}
table4b %>% 
  pivot_longer(c(`1999`, `2000`), names_to = "year", values_to = "population")
```

## 12.3.1 Longer {.smaller}

To combine the tidied versions of `table4a` and `table4b` into a single tibble, we need to use `dplyr::left_join()`, which you’ll learn about in relational data.

```{r}
tidy4a <- table4a %>% 
  pivot_longer(c(`1999`, `2000`), names_to = "year", values_to = "cases")
tidy4b <- table4b %>% 
  pivot_longer(c(`1999`, `2000`), names_to = "year", values_to = "population")
left_join(tidy4a, tidy4b)
```

## 12.3.2 Wider {.smaller}

`pivot_wider()` is the opposite of `pivot_longer()`. You use it when an observation is scattered across multiple rows. For example, take `table2`: an observation is a country in a year, but each observation is spread across two rows.

```{r}
table2
```

## 12.3.2 Wider

To tidy this up, we first analyse the representation in similar way to `pivot_longer()`. This time, however, we only need two parameters:

- The column to take variable names from. Here, it’s `type`.

- The column to take values from. Here it’s `count`.

## 12.3.2 Wider

```{r}
table2 %>%
    pivot_wider(names_from = type, values_from = count)
```

## 12.3.2 Wider

Pivoting `table2` into a “wider”, tidy form.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/8350f0dda414629b9d6c354f87acf5c5f722be43/bcb84/images/tidy-8.png')
```

*colname of `table2` should be `type` and `count`.

## 12.4 Separating and uniting

- So far you’ve learned how to tidy `table2` and `table4`, but not `table3`. 

- `table3` has a different problem: we have one column (`rate`) that contains two variables (`cases` and `population`). 

- To fix this problem, we’ll need the `separate()` function. You’ll also learn about the complement of `separate()`: `unite()`, which you use if a single variable is spread across multiple columns.

## 12.4.1 Separate

`separate()` pulls apart one column into multiple columns, by splitting wherever a separator character appears. Take `table3`:

```{r}
table3
```

## 12.4.1 Separate

```{r}
table3 %>% 
  separate(rate, into = c("cases", "population"))
```

## 12.4.1 Separate

Separating `table3` makes it tidy

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/f6fca537e77896868fedcd85d9d01031930d76c9/637d9/images/tidy-17.png')
```

## 12.4.1 Separate

By default, `separate()` will split values wherever it sees a non-alphanumeric character (i.e. a character that isn’t a number or letter). 

For example, in the code above, `separate()` split the values of `rate` at the forward slash characters. 

If you wish to use a specific character to separate a column, you can pass the character to the `sep` argument of `separate()`. For example, we could rewrite the code above as:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
table3 %>% 
  separate(rate, into = c("cases", "population"), sep = "/")
```

## 12.4.1 Separate

Look carefully at the column types: you’ll notice that `cases` and `population` are character columns. 
This is the default behavior in `separate()`: it leaves the type of the column as is. We can ask `separate()` to convert to better types using `convert = TRUE`:

```{r}
table3 %>% 
  separate(rate, into = c("cases", "population"), convert = TRUE)
```

## 12.4.1 Separate

Separate the last two digits of each year:

```{r}
table3 %>% 
  separate(year, into = c("century", "year"), sep = 2)
```

*sep value is the position to split at

## 12.4.2 Unite

`unite()` is the inverse of `separate()`: it combines multiple columns into a single column. You’ll need it much less frequently than `separate()`, but it’s still a useful tool.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/3d98d3ba019fed3f9ee328284568d4508e479ef8/0b3e6/images/tidy-18.png')
```

## 12.4.2 Unite

```{r}
table5 %>% 
  unite(new, century, year)
```

## 12.4.2 Unite

```{r}
table5 %>% 
  unite(new, century, year, sep = "")
```

## 12.5 Missing values

```{r}
stocks <- tibble(
  year   = c(2015, 2015, 2015, 2015, 2016, 2016, 2016),
  qtr    = c(   1,    2,    3,    4,    2,    3,    4),
  return = c(1.88, 0.59, 0.35,   NA, 0.92, 0.17, 2.66)
)
```

2 missing values in this dataset:

- The return for the fourth quarter of 2015 is explicitly missing, because the cell where its value should be instead contains NA.

- The return for the first quarter of 2016 is implicitly missing, because it simply does not appear in the dataset.

## 12.5 Missing values

The way that a dataset is represented can make implicit values explicit. For example, we can make the implicit missing value explicit by putting years in the columns:

```{r}
stocks %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = year, values_from = return)
```

## 12.5 Missing values {.smaller}

Because these explicit missing values may not be important in other representations of the data, you can set `values_drop_na = TRUE` in `pivot_longer()` to turn explicit missing values implicit:

```{r}
stocks %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = year, values_from = return) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c(`2015`, `2016`), 
    names_to = "year", 
    values_to = "return", 
    values_drop_na = TRUE
  )
```


## 12.5 Missing values

Another important tool for making missing values explicit in tidy data is `complete()`:

```{r}
stocks %>% 
  complete(year, qtr)
```

## 12.5 Missing values

There’s one other important tool that you should know for working with missing values. Sometimes when a data source has primarily been used for data entry, missing values indicate that the previous value should be carried forward:

```{r}
treatment <- tribble(
  ~ person,           ~ treatment, ~response,
  "Derrick Whitmore", 1,           7,
  NA,                 2,           10,
  NA,                 3,           9,
  "Katherine Burke",  1,           4
)
```

## 12.5 Missing values

You can fill in these missing values with `fill()`:

```{r}
treatment %>% 
  fill(person)
```

## 12.6 Case Study {.smaller}

The `tidyr::who` dataset contains tuberculosis (TB) cases broken down by year, country, age, gender, and diagnosis method. The data comes from the 2014 World Health Organization Global Tuberculosis Report.

```{r, class.output="scroll-100"}
who
```

## 12.6 Case Study 

```{r}
names(who)
```

## 12.6 Case Study

- This is a very typical real-life example dataset. It contains redundant columns, odd variable codes, and many missing values. 

- In short, `who` is messy, and we’ll need multiple steps to tidy it. 

- Like dplyr, tidyr is designed so that each function does one thing well. That means in real-life situations you’ll usually need to string together multiple verbs into a pipeline.

## 12.6 Case Study

The best place to start is almost always to gather together the columns that are not variables. Let’s have a look at what we’ve got:

- It looks like `country`, `iso2`, and `iso3` are three variables that redundantly specify the country.

- `year` is clearly also a variable.

- We don’t know what all the other columns are yet, but given the structure in the variable names (e.g. `new_sp_m014`, `new_ep_m014`, `new_ep_f014`) these are likely to be values, not variables.

## 12.6 Case Study

- So we need to gather together all the columns from `new_sp_m014` to `newrel_f65`. 

- We don’t know what those values represent yet, so we’ll give them the generic name `"key"`. 

- We know the cells represent the count of `cases`, so we’ll use the variable `cases`. 

- There are a lot of missing values in the current representation, so for now we’ll use `values_drop_na` just so we can focus on the values that are present.

## 12.6 Case Study {.smaller}
```{r}
who1 <- who %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = new_sp_m014:newrel_f65, 
    names_to = "key", 
    values_to = "cases", 
    values_drop_na = TRUE
  )
who1
```

## 12.6 Case Study {.smaller}

We can get some hint of the structure of the values in the new `key` column by counting them:

```{r}
who1 %>% 
  count(key)
```

## 12.6 Case Study {.smaller}

You might be able to parse this out by yourself with a little thought and some experimentation, but luckily we have the data dictionary handy. It tells us:

1. The first three letters of each column denote whether the column contains new or old cases of TB. In this dataset, each column contains new cases.

2. The next two letters describe the type of TB: rel = relapse, ep = extrapulmonary TB, sn = pulmonary TB that could not be diagnosed by a pulmonary smear (smear negative), sp = pulmonary TB that could be diagnosed by a pulmonary smear (smear positive)

3. The sixth letter gives the sex of TB patients. The dataset groups cases by males (m) and females (f).

4. The remaining numbers gives the age group. The dataset groups cases into 7 age groups: 014 = 0 – 14 years old, 1524 = 15 – 24 years old, 2534 = 25 – 34 years old, 3544 = 35 – 44 years old, 4554 = 45 – 54 years old, 5564 = 55 – 64 years old, 65 = 65 or older

## 12.6 Case Study

- We need to make a minor fix to the format of the column names: unfortunately the names are slightly inconsistent because instead of `new_rel` we have `newrel` (it’s hard to spot this here but if you don’t fix it we’ll get errors in subsequent steps). 

- You’ll learn about `str_replace()` in strings, but the basic idea is pretty simple: replace the characters “newrel” with “new_rel”. This makes all variable names consistent.

## 12.6 Case Study

```{r}
who2 <- who1 %>% 
  mutate(key = stringr::str_replace(key, "newrel", "new_rel"))
who2
```

## 12.6 Case Study 

```{r}
unique(who2$key)
```

## 12.6 Case Study {.smaller}

We can separate the values in each code with two passes of `separate()`. The first pass will split the codes at each underscore.

```{r}
who3 <- who2 %>% 
  separate(key, c("new", "type", "sexage"), sep = "_")
who3
```

## 12.6 Case Study

Then we might as well drop the `new` column because it’s constant in this dataset. While we’re dropping columns, let’s also drop `iso2` and `iso3` since they’re redundant.

```{r}
who3 %>% 
  count(new)
who4 <- who3 %>% 
  select(-new, -iso2, -iso3)
```

## 12.6 Case Study {.smaller}

Next we’ll separate sexage into `sex` and `age` by splitting after the first character:

```{r}
who5 <- who4 %>% 
  separate(sexage, c("sex", "age"), sep = 1)
who5
```

## 12.6 Case Study {.smaller}

The `who` dataset is now tidy!

Put them all together:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
who %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = new_sp_m014:newrel_f65, 
    names_to = "key", 
    values_to = "cases", 
    values_drop_na = TRUE
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    key = stringr::str_replace(key, "newrel", "new_rel")
  ) %>%
  separate(key, c("new", "var", "sexage")) %>% 
  select(-new, -iso2, -iso3) %>% 
  separate(sexage, c("sex", "age"), sep = 1)
```
